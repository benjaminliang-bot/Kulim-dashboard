Summary:

Completed 10 MEX visits (2 were rescheduled from last week).

Most merchants operate on multiple platforms, GF is generally the strongest. Delivery sales are often lower than dine-in, and pricing or menu information frequently needs updating.

Most MEX are satisfied with current sales and results from past campaigns. They are hesitant to join new campaigns or bear marketing costs, but some are open to trial campaigns after observing sales trends.

Visits focus on maintaining relationships, assisting with platform updates (location, pricing, menu), and monitoring competitor activity. Resistance to meetings is common, but support is usually given for non-cost initiatives.

Key Findings (Competitor/Other Findings):

Some MEX receive orders from other platforms (MISI), showing cross-platform competition.

A few merchants have offboarded from FoodPanda due to payment issues (Wan's Burger Crispy - Taman Kenari). Trying to build a good relationship with these merchants.

Support Needed:

Merchants feedback lack of orders and visibility but do not have the urgency to join campaigns.

Summary:

Completed 3 visits

The focus of visits was on menu/pricing optimization and understanding readiness for future campaigns.

Key Findings (Competitor/Other Findings):

GF was the strongest platform for both MEX, but sales have recently dropped.

MEX on organic sales across multiple platforms, with limited awareness that delivery campaigns can help boost sales further.

Support Needed:

Help MEX complete menus with proper photos to improve visibility. (Photoshooting session for selected MEX maybe?)

Educate merchants on delivery campaigns’ potential to drive incremental sales beyond organic orders. (Low interest with GMC)

September (Week 4)

Summary:

Menu Optimization Support: Assisted Restoran Abu Khalid (2 outlets) to update pricing and restructure their menu. Progress is pending completion as both merchants are unable to provide food photos.

T20 Outreach: Contacted multiple T20 merchants. Chuan Kee Lunas (meeting confirmed: 30 Sep, 3 PM), Restoran Kak Wan (pending confirmation) others did not pick up or have yet to respond.

This Week Plan:

Target additional 2-3 T20 MEX for appointments to assess readiness and explore potential campaign participation.

Continue educating merchants on how delivery campaigns can generate incremental sales beyond organic orders, addressing low GMC interest.

Identify and reach out to merchants not yet onboarded on GF to acquire new high potential MEX to expand pipeline.

Summary:

Most MEX actively compared sales between platforms (FoodPanda vs GF), noting stronger performance on FoodPanda, especially when campaigns are active.

Several MEX requested assistance with price amendments and menu optimization before deciding to join HD.

Key Findings (Competitor/Other Findings):

MEX generally see higher sales on FoodPanda due to active discount campaigns, while GF performance remains slower.

Merchants are cautious about joining campaigns due to low selling prices and margin concerns.

Interest in HD is strong among MEX once pricing is optimized, short term testing (one month) is a preferred approach.

Support Needed:

MEX requested merchandise for instore visibility, currently only aprons are available, which most merchants are not keen to take.

October (Week 4)

Summary:

No on-ground visits this week as most MEX couldn’t make it for appointments.

Focused on updating pricing and restructuring MEX menus, progress ongoing as some merchants haven’t provided food photos yet.

- Teck Kee Ah Huat Restaurant (food photo and price adjustment completed.)- Budak Burger (partial price markup completed, still pending food photos from MEX)

Worked on acquisition by reviewing potential merchants through the FoodPanda platform.

Successfully contacted one MEX who agreed to join GF (pending documentation completion), also in progress with documentation for other MEX acquisition cases.

This week plan:

Continue menu restructuring and price optimization for pending MEX (especially those still missing food photos).

Follow up with MEX who showed interest in joining HD and KJ after recent discussions.

Continue reviewing potential acquisition leads via FoodPanda platform to identify more MEX with strong sales potential.

Continue reaching out to MEX who haven’t picked up or responded to maintain engagement and widen outreach.

Plan to visit MEX outside the two main focus areas since most within the areas have already been contacted. 

October (Week 5)

Summary:

Mainly working on menu optimization due to no onground visits this week as most merchants in the two focus areas have already been approached.

Progress Summary:

Uncle Lim 林大树餐馆

Action: Completed price adjustment.

Reason: Previous pricing too low, MEX mentioned inability to afford HD fee due to cost issue.

Outcome: MEX agreed to join 1 month HD trial after price revision.

Da Fan Shu Kuay Tiao Sup 大番薯粿条汤

Action: Partial price markup in progress.

Reason: MEX currently facing manpower shortage.
