   - **Scale top performers**: HOSPRAI, IHOS, XILNEX
   - **Expand penetration**: Currently only 0.4% of GMV - significant opportunity
   - **Monitor growth**: Track if growth rate sustains or accelerates

### Next Steps:

1. Investigate "MGS" definition for KVAM analysis
2. Deep dive into top SD promo codes (HOSPRAI, IHOS, XILNEX) to understand success factors
