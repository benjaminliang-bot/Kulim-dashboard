## 🎯 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS (UPDATED)

### PRIORITY 1: HALAL MERCHANT ACQUISITION (HIGHEST IMPACT) ⚠️ CORRECTED

**Why**: Only **0.67% of merchants are Halal** (159 out of 23,583), but demand exists (validated by previous analysis)

**Target**:
- **Butterworth**: Acquire 20+ Halal merchants (largest market, only 0.7% Halal)
- **Bukit Minyak**: Acquire 10+ Halal merchants (411 merchants, 0 Halal - critical gap)
- **Bukit Teh**: Acquire 5+ Halal merchants (114 merchants, 0 Halal)
- **Areas with <1% Halal**: Simpang Ampat, Alma Jaya_Mukim 14, Seberang Jaya_Mukim 15

**Expected Impact**: 
- 35+ new Halal merchants = ~2-3M MYR additional GMV/month
- Capture unmet Halal demand (estimated 20-30% of Mainland market)

**Timeline**: 3 months

---

### PRIORITY 2: LUNCH MERCHANT ACQUISITION (HIGHEST VOLUME)

**Why**: 12-1 PM accounts for 19% of daily orders (highest volume window)

**Target**:
- Acquire merchants optimized for lunch (11 AM - 2 PM operations)
- Focus on quick-prep cuisines (Nasi Lemak, Fried Rice, Noodles)
- Target areas: Butterworth, Alma Jaya, Seberang Jaya (highest lunch volume)

**Expected Impact**:
- Capture 5-10% additional lunch orders = ~1-2M MYR/month
- Improve lunch variety (reduce search friction)

**Timeline**: 2 months

---

### PRIORITY 3: FAMILY BUNDLE CAMPAIGNS (HIGHEST VALUE)

**Why**: 41.8% of orders are 25+ MYR (family meal segment)

**Target**:
- Launch "Family Bundle" promos (25-40 MYR range)
- Target dinner hours (6-7 PM) where basket sizes peak (34.75 MYR)
- Promote larger orders (40+ MYR) with volume discounts

**Expected Impact**:
- Increase AOV by 10-15% = ~1-1.5M MYR/month
- Improve merchant margins (higher order values)

**Timeline**: 1 month (quick win)

---

### PRIORITY 4: WIN-BACK DORMANT MERCHANTS (FASTEST)

**Why**: Many merchants are inactive (need to verify exact %)

**Target**:
- Identify top 100 dormant merchants by historical GMV
- Re-engage with menu optimization, pricing review, campaign support
- Focus on areas with low active rates

**Expected Impact**:
- Reactivate 30-50 merchants = ~0.5-1M MYR/month
- Faster than new acquisition (merchants already onboarded)

**Timeline**: 1 month

---

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Halal Merchant Acquisition is Slow
**Mitigation**: 
- Partner with Halal certification bodies
- Offer onboarding incentives

**Mitigation**:
- Test in high-basket areas first (Butterworth, Seberang Jaya)
- Use data to target right customer segments
- Monitor basket size trends weekly

### Risk 3: Dormant Merchants Don't Reactivate
**Mitigation**:
- Understand churn reasons (survey)
- Address root causes (pricing, operations, support)
- Focus on high-value merchants first
