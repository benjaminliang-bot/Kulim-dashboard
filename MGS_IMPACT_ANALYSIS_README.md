# MGS Individual Impact Analysis - Status

## Current Situation

You provided a list of **494 MGS assignments**:
- **Teoh Jun Ling**: 179 merchants
- **Lee Sook Chin**: 134 merchants  
- **Low Jia Ying**: 100 merchants
- **Hon Yi Ni**: 81 merchants

## Challenge

To calculate individual MGS impact (like I did for AMs), I need:
1. **Merchant IDs** that correspond to each MGS assignment
2. The list you provided has MGS names but not merchant IDs

## Options to Proceed

### Option 1: Read from Main Tracker V2 Sheet
I tried reading the sheet but couldn't identify which column contains MGS assignments. 

**Can you tell me:**
- Which column in "Main Tracker V2" contains the MGS assignments?
- Which column contains the merchant IDs?

Once I know this, I can read the sheet and match merchant IDs with MGS names.

### Option 2: Provide Merchant IDs
If you can provide the merchant IDs for each MGS (in any format - CSV, JSON, or list), I can immediately generate and execute the impact queries.

### Option 3: Use Existing Segmentation Data
I have limited merchant-to-MGS mapping from the segmentation JSON (only ~7 merchants). This won't give accurate results for all 494 merchants.

## What I'll Calculate (Once I Have Merchant IDs)

For each MGS, I'll provide the same detailed analysis as I did for AMs:

### 6-Month Total Impact:
- Total GMV (RM)
- % of Penang GMV
- Unique merchants
- Total orders
- Unique eaters

### Efficiency Metrics:
- Average GMV per merchant
- Average GMV per order
- Average GMV per eater

### Growth Metrics:
- First 3 months GMV vs Last 3 months GMV
- Growth rate (%)
- Absolute growth (RM)

### Monthly Trends:
- GMV by month
- % of Penang GMV by month
- Month-over-month changes

### Comparison:
- Rank each MGS by impact
- Compare with AM performance (Chia Yee, Darren, Suki)

## Next Step

**Please let me know:**
1. Which column in Main Tracker V2 has MGS assignments? (e.g., Column K, Column L, etc.)
2. OR provide merchant IDs for each MGS in any format

Then I'll immediately generate and execute the queries to give you individual MGS impact results!
