## KEY INSIGHTS & OBSERVATIONS

### Growth Drivers
1. **Menu Optimization:** Primary driver of campaign interest - merchants more willing to join HD after pricing/menu updates
2. **Short-Term Trials:** 1-month campaign trials preferred approach, reduces risk perception
3. **Fully-Funded Campaigns:** Effective for T20 engagement (e.g., Simpang Tiga Tomyam)
4. **Price Adjustment:** Critical enabler - merchants unable to afford HD fees until pricing optimized

### Challenges & Risks
1. **Low Campaign Receptiveness:** 
   - Margin concerns due to low selling prices
   - Competition awareness making full markup hesitant
   - Preference for external marketing (TikTok) over delivery campaigns

2. **Menu Operations Gap:**
   - Most merchants lack menu photos
   - Pricing not updated since onboarding
   - Delivery prices often lower than in-store

3. **Platform Competition:**
   - AK showing stronger performance when campaigns active
   - GF performance slower, especially without campaigns
   - Cross-platform competition (MISI, HADA, Shopee)

4. **Acquisition Challenges:**
   - Payment issues causing AK offboarding
   - Low urgency to join campaigns despite order volume concerns
   - Appointment resistance common

### Opportunities
1. **Menu Optimization Pipeline:** Large number of merchants need photo/pricing updates - systematic approach could drive engagement
2. **T20 Engagement:** 18.52% coverage - significant opportunity to expand T20 outreach
3. **Acquisition from Competitors:** Merchants offboarded from AK due to payment issues - relationship building opportunity
4. **Focus Area Expansion:** Only 8-18% coverage in focus areas - room for systematic outreach
5. **Campaign Education:** Limited awareness of incremental sales potential - education could drive participation
