## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive data analysis across Supply, Demand, and Operations dimensions, the Penang Mainland market shows significant growth potential with clear opportunities in merchant acquisition, demand fulfillment, and operational optimization.

---

## 1. SUPPLY ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Merchant Landscape (Query 1)

**Key Findings:**
- **Active Merchants:** 1,000+ active merchants across Mainland areas
- **Halal Coverage:** Mix of Halal and Non-Halal merchants, with strong Enterprise presence in key areas (e.g., AEON Bukit Mertajam)
- **Merchant Segments:**
  - **Enterprise:** Strong presence (KFC, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Starbucks, etc.)
  - **Mid-Market:** Moderate presence
  - **Long-Tail:** Dominant segment with high churn risk

**Critical Insights:**
1. **High Churn Risk:** Many merchants show "Never Completed" status or churned >12 months ago
2. **Cuisine Diversity:** Wide range of cuisine IDs present, but need cuisine name mapping for gap analysis
3. **Geographic Concentration:** Heavy merchant density in Alma Jaya and Bukit Mertajam areas

**Action Items:**
- **Win-Back Campaign:** Target 500+ churned merchants (Query 5 results) - faster ROI than new acquisition
- **Cuisine Gap Analysis:** Map cuisine IDs to names to identify underserved cuisines
- **Halal Expansion:** Assess Halal merchant coverage by area to target Muslim-majority zones

### 1.2 Churned/Inactive Merchants (Query 5)

**Key Findings:**
- **Churned Merchants:** 500+ merchants identified with no completed orders in last 12 months
- **Churn Categories:**
  - **Never Completed:** Merchants who never received a completed order
  - **Churned (>12 months):** Last order >12 months ago
  - **Inactive (6-12 months):** Last order 6-12 months ago

**Top Churned Merchant Examples:**
- Many Long-Tail merchants in food courts and hawker centers
- Mix of Halal and Non-Halal
- Concentrated in Alma Jaya, Bukit Mertajam areas

**Action Items:**
- **Priority Win-Back List:** Focus on merchants with historical orders (faster reactivation)
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate why merchants churned (operational issues, low demand, etc.)
- **Incentive Programs:** Design win-back campaigns with reduced commissions or marketing support

## 2. DEMAND ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Hourly Order Distribution (Query 2)

**Key Findings:**

**Peak Hours (Mainland):**
- **Lunch Peak:** 12:00-13:00 (198K orders) - Strong family meal demand
- **Dinner Peak:** 18:00-19:00 (164K orders) - Family dinner market confirmed
- **Late Night:** 22:00-23:00 (52K-30K orders) - Moderate supper market

**Mainland vs Island Comparison:**
- **Mainland Order Share:** 20-30% of Island orders across most hours
- **Peak Performance:** Mainland performs best during lunch (24.15% of Island) and dinner (24.06% of Island)
- **Basket Size:** Mainland avg basket size (27-35 RM) is **LOWER** than Island (32-40 RM), indicating:
  - Potential for upselling/family meal promotions
  - Price sensitivity may be higher
  - Smaller household sizes or different ordering behavior

**Critical Insights:**
1. **NOT a "Supper Market":** Mainland shows strong dinner (6-8 PM) and lunch (12-1 PM) peaks, NOT late-night (10 PM-2 AM)
2. **Family Dinner Market Confirmed:** Peak at 6-7 PM aligns with family meal times
3. **Growth Opportunity:** Mainland is only 20-30% of Island volume - significant headroom

**Action Items:**
- **Target Family Meals:** Promote larger basket sizes during dinner hours (6-8 PM)
- **Lunch Promotions:** Focus marketing on 11 AM-1 PM window
- **Avoid Late-Night Focus:** Don't invest heavily in 10 PM-2 AM marketing (low demand)

### 2.2 Basket Size Distribution (Query 3)

**Key Findings:**

**Mainland Basket Distribution:**
- **0-15 RM:** 19.2% of orders (362K orders) - Snack/individual meals
- **15-25 RM:** 29.2% of orders (551K orders) - Standard meals (LARGEST SEGMENT)
- **25-40 RM:** 29.8% of orders (563K orders) - Family meals (LARGEST SEGMENT)
- **40-60 RM:** 13.7% of orders (258K orders) - Large family meals
- **60+ RM:** 8.1% of orders (152K orders) - Premium/party orders

**Mainland vs Island Comparison:**
- **Mainland:** 59% of orders are 15-40 RM (standard to family meals)
- **Island:** 57.9% of orders are 15-40 RM (similar pattern)
- **Key Difference:** Island has higher % of 60+ RM orders (12.4% vs 8.1%), indicating:
  - Mainland customers are more price-sensitive
  - Opportunity to upsell premium/family bundles

**Critical Insights:**
1. **Family Meal Opportunity:** 29.8% of orders are 25-40 RM (family size) - validate "Family Market" hypothesis
2. **Upsell Potential:** Only 8.1% of orders are 60+ RM vs 12.4% on Island - room to grow premium orders
3. **Price Sensitivity:** Higher concentration in 15-25 RM range suggests price-conscious market

**Action Items:**
- **Family Bundle Promotions:** Create 25-40 RM family meal deals
- **Upsell Campaigns:** Target 15-25 RM customers with "upgrade to family size" offers
- **Premium Merchant Acquisition:** Bring in higher-end restaurants to capture 60+ RM segment

### 2.3 Failed Searches / Session Drop-Off (Query 7)

**Key Findings:**

**Top Session Drop-Off Areas & Hours:**
1. **Butterworth - 22:00:** 67 sessions with no orders (3.5% drop-off rate)
2. **Prai - 21:00:** 66 sessions with no orders (2.1% drop-off rate)
3. **Alma Jaya - 19:00:** 63 sessions with no orders (0.8% drop-off rate)
4. **Seberang Jaya - 12:00:** 63 sessions with no orders (0.8% drop-off rate)

**Pattern Analysis:**
- **Peak Drop-Off Hours:** 21:00-23:00 (late evening) - likely due to:
  - Limited merchant availability
  - High delivery fees
  - No search results for desired cuisines
- **Lunch Drop-Off:** 10:00-12:00 also shows drop-off, suggesting:
  - Supply gaps during lunch rush
  - Merchant capacity constraints

**Critical Insights:**
1. **Unmet Demand:** 3,000+ sessions with no orders in last 3 months = significant lost GMV
2. **Late-Night Gap:** Highest drop-off at 22:00-23:00 suggests need for late-night merchant coverage
3. **Low Overall Drop-Off:** Most areas show <2% drop-off, indicating good conversion when supply exists

**Action Items:**
- **Late-Night Merchant Acquisition:** Target 24-hour or late-night merchants for 22:00-2:00 window
- **Search Optimization:** Investigate what users search for during drop-off hours
- **Merchant Capacity:** Ensure high-demand merchants can handle lunch/dinner rush
