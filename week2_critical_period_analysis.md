## 5. Comparison to Other Critical Events

### Week 2 vs Major Flood Event (Nov 20-24)

| Event | Duration | GMV Loss | Orders Lost | Cities Affected | Severity |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Week 2 (Oct 20-26)** | **7 days** | **-MYR 5.77M** | **-52,991** | **6+ cities** | 🔴 **Largest weekly loss** |
| Nov Flood (Nov 20-24) | 5 days | -MYR 214K (Kota Bharu only) | -7,528 (Kota Bharu only) | 1-2 cities | 🔴 Single city focused |

**Why Week 2 is More Critical:**
- **Larger financial impact:** -MYR 5.77M vs -MYR 214K (27x larger)
- **More cities affected:** 6+ cities vs 1-2 cities
- **Longer duration:** 7 days vs 5 days
- **Broader impact:** Affects top cities (Penang, Ipoh) vs single city (Kota Bharu)

### Week 2 vs Worst Single Day (Oct 3)

| Event | Duration | GMV Impact | Orders Impact | Cities Affected | Severity |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Week 2 (Oct 20-26)** | **7 days** | **-MYR 5.77M** | **-52,991** | **6+ cities** | 🔴 **Extended period** |
| Oct 3 (Worst Day) | 1 day | Normal GMV | Normal orders | 7 cities | 🔴 Single day, operational impact only |

**Why Week 2 is More Critical:**
- **Financial impact:** -MYR 5.77M vs no GMV loss (Oct 3 had operational impact but no GMV loss)
- **Extended period:** 7 days vs 1 day

## 6. Recovery Pattern - Validates Critical Status

### Week 1 Recovery (Oct 27-Nov 2) - Strong Bounce-Back

**OC Overall Recovery:**
- **GMV Growth:** +MYR 10.20M (+17.2%)
- **Orders Growth:** +172,872 (+10.0%)
- **Sessions Growth:** +149,290 (+9.8%)

**City Recovery:**
- **Penang:** +26.1% GMV (strongest recovery)
- **Kuching:** +25.4% GMV
- **Ipoh:** +16.3% GMV
- **Alor Setar:** +11.2% GMV

**Why This Validates Critical Status:**
- **Strong recovery** indicates Week 2 was a temporary disruption (not permanent demand loss)
- **Bounce-back pattern** suggests suppressed demand during Week 2, released in Week 1
- **Recovery magnitude** (+17.2% GMV) nearly 3x the Week 2 loss (-8.7% GMV), indicating pent-up demand

## 7. Root Cause Analysis - Why Week 2 Was Critical

### Weather Pattern (Inferred from Data)

**Extended Period of Heavy Rain/Flooding:**
- **Oct 18-19:** Early signs (Kota Kinabalu, Ipoh, Penang, Kemaman <90% completion)
- **Oct 20:** Multi-city disruption (Penang, Ipoh, Kuantan, Sungai Petani)
- **Oct 22:** Continued impact (Penang 89.1%)
- **Oct 23:** Peak disruption (Penang -49.1% GMV, Ipoh -41.9% GMV)
- **Oct 24:** Continued impact (Kota Bharu, Ipoh, Kemaman)
- **Oct 25:** Continued impact (Kemaman 88.9%)

**Pattern:** Extended period of heavy rain/flooding affecting northern/east coast regions over 7 consecutive days

### Operational Impact Chain

1. **Restaurant Closures:** Flooded premises unable to operate
   - Evidence: Unallocated orders, cancelled merchant orders
   
2. **Delivery Disruption:** Flooded roads, driver safety concerns
   - Evidence: Cancelled driver orders, order expirations
   
3. **Demand Suppression:** Customers not ordering during floods
   - Evidence: 40,565 sessions lost (-2.5%), 52,991 orders lost (-2.9%)

4. **Extended Duration:** 7 consecutive days of impact
   - Evidence: Multiple cities affected across Oct 20-26

## Conclusion: Why Week 2 is "Critical"

**Week 2 (Oct 20-26) is labeled "critical" because it represents:**

1. **Largest Financial Impact:** -MYR 5.77M GMV loss (largest weekly loss)
2. **Only Negative Week:** Only week showing negative growth vs baseline

5. **Extended Duration:** Continuous impact over full week (not isolated event)
6. **Operational Severity:** Multiple cities dropping to 85-87% completion rates
7. **Strategic Significance:** Impact on key cities (Penang, Ipoh) that drive OC performance

**The "critical" label is justified by the combination of:**
- **Magnitude** (largest loss)
- **Scope** (multiple cities)
- **Duration** (7 consecutive days)
