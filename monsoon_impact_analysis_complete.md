## 6. Causal Analysis

### 6.1 Direct Impact Channels

#### A. Delivery Operations Disruption
**Evidence:**
- Completion rate drops to 84-87% on affected days (vs normal 92-93%)
- **Oct 20:** Penang (87.3%) + Ipoh (85.4%) - Multi-city suggests regional weather event
- **Oct 23:** Penang (87.6%) + Ipoh (86.2%) - Continued regional impact

**Impact:**
- Flooded roads → Delivery delays → Lower completion rates
- Driver safety concerns → Reduced driver availability
- **Estimated Impact:** 5-8pp completion rate drop = ~5-8% of orders affected

#### B. Consumer Behavior Changes
**Evidence:**
- Sessions decline in Week 2 (-2.5%)
- Lower order volume despite stable sessions on some days

**Impact:**
- Reduced app usage during heavy rain/flood
- Safety concerns → Less ordering
- **Estimated Impact:** 2.5% session decline = ~40K fewer sessions

#### C. Merchant Operations
**Evidence:**
- Order volume drops on specific days
- Completion rate drops suggest merchant closures or limited operations

**Impact:**
- Flooded kitchens/premises → Restaurant closures
- Supply chain disruptions → Limited menu availability
- **Estimated Impact:** Contributes to 52,991 lost orders in Week 2

### 6.2 Secondary Impact Channels

1. **Network Effects**
   - Reduced driver availability → Longer wait times → Lower conversion
   - Restaurant closures → Fewer options → Lower basket size

2. **Recovery Lag**
   - Post-flood cleanup → Delayed merchant reopening
   - Consumer confidence → Gradual return to normal ordering

---

## 10. Recommendations

### 10.1 Immediate Actions (Next Monsoon Season)

1. **Weather Monitoring Integration**
   - Integrate weather alerts into operations dashboard
   - Proactive communication to drivers/merchants during forecasted heavy rain
   - **ROI:** Prevent ~MYR 5.77M GMV loss per severe weather week

2. **Operational Adjustments**
   - Increase driver incentives during adverse weather (+20-30% surge pricing)
   - Extend delivery time SLAs during flood periods (add 15-20 min buffer)
   - Temporary merchant fee adjustments for affected areas (reduce commission 2-3pp)

3. **Customer Communication**
   - In-app notifications about potential delays
   - Transparent messaging about weather impact
   - Proactive order cancellation with full refund for severe weather

### 10.2 Medium-Term Actions (Next 3-6 Months)

1. **Resilience Building**
   - Identify flood-prone merchant locations (map historical flood zones)
   - **Priority cities:** Penang, Alor Setar, Ipoh (highest vulnerability)
   - Develop alternative delivery routes (avoid flood-prone areas)
   - Partner with weather services for early warning (3-5 day forecasts)
   - **Focus on northern/east coast cities:** Penang, Alor Setar, Kota Bharu, Kuantan, Sungai Petani, Kemaman

2. **Data-Driven Response**
   - Build predictive model for weather impact (ML model using historical data)
   - Pre-allocate resources based on weather forecasts (driver surge, merchant prep)
   - Dynamic pricing/incentives during forecasted disruptions (surge pricing 24-48h ahead)

3. **Merchant Support**
   - Flood-proofing support for high-risk merchants
   - Alternative preparation methods during forecasted disruptions
   - Supply chain backup plans

### 10.3 Long-Term Actions (6-12 Months)

1. **Infrastructure**
   - Work with local authorities on flood mitigation
   - Support merchant flood-proofing initiatives
   - Develop alternative delivery methods (boats, etc.) for flood-prone areas

2. **Insurance & Risk Management**
   - Weather disruption insurance for merchants
   - Driver safety protocols during adverse weather
   - Business continuity planning

---

## 11. Key Insights & Strategic Implications

### 11.1 Weather Impact is Significant but Recoverable

- **Week 2 Loss:** MYR 5.77M GMV
- **Week 1 Recovery:** +MYR 10.20M GMV (exceeds loss)
- **Net 4-Week:** +MYR 5.39M GMV (positive despite disruption)

**Implication:** Weather causes temporary disruption, but strong recovery suggests:
- Demand is resilient
- Operational recovery is quick
- **Action:** Focus on minimizing disruption duration, not preventing it entirely

### 11.2 Northern/East Coast Cities are Most Vulnerable

**High-Risk Cities (Week 2 Impact > 10%):**
1. Penang (coastal, -23.2% GMV, 3 severe days)
2. Alor Setar (northern, -17.2% GMV, worst single day: 80.4% completion) ⚠️ **NEW**
3. Ipoh (inland but -16.6% GMV, 4 severe days - regional flooding?)
4. Kuching (east coast, -10.6% GMV, 2 moderate days)

**Moderate-Risk Cities (Week 2 Impact 5-10%):**
5. Kota Bharu (east coast, -8.7% GMV, 2 severe days) ⚠️ **NEW**
6. Sungai Petani (northern, -6.2% GMV, 2 severe days) ⚠️ **NEW**

**Low-Risk Cities:**
- Kuantan (east coast, -3.7% GMV) ⚠️ **NEW**
- Johor Bahru (southern, -4.1% GMV, minimal impact)
- Kota Kinabalu (east coast, -2.7% GMV)
- Kemaman (east coast, +7.6% GMV - positive growth) ⚠️ **NEW**

**Implication:** 
- **Targeted interventions** for high-risk cities (Penang, Alor Setar, Ipoh, Kuching)
- **Regional weather monitoring** for northern/east coast (all 10 cities)
- **Pre-positioned resources** during monsoon season (Nov-Mar)
- **Alor Setar requires special attention** - highest single-day impact (80.4% completion)

### 11.3 Completion Rate is the Best Early Indicator

**Pattern:**
- Completion rate drops precede GMV/order declines
- 84-87% completion rate = severe disruption
- 89-90% completion rate = moderate disruption

**Implication:**
- **Real-time monitoring** of completion rates by city
- **Alert threshold:** Completion rate < 90% triggers weather response protocol
- **Predictive:** Completion rate trends can forecast GMV impact

---

## 12. Forecast for Remaining Monsoon Season

### Expected Impact (Nov 2025 - Mar 2026)

**Assumptions:**
- 1-2 severe weather weeks per month during peak monsoon (Dec-Feb)
- Similar impact magnitude as Week 2 (Oct 20-26)
- Recovery pattern similar to Week 1

**Forecast:**
- **Monthly GMV Risk:** ~MYR 5-6M per severe weather week
- **Peak Season (Dec-Feb):** 3-6 severe weeks = **MYR 15-36M GMV at risk**
- **Mitigation Potential:** With proactive measures, reduce impact by 30-50% = **Save MYR 5-18M**
