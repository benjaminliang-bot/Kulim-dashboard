## Recommendations

### 1. Real-Time Weather Monitoring
- **Integrate weather alerts** with operations dashboard
- **Track daily rainfall** for each city
- **Set thresholds:** >50mm rainfall = alert, >100mm = action

### 2. City-Specific Protocols
- **High-risk cities:** Penang, Alor Setar, Ipoh, Kota Bharu, Kuantan
- **East coast cities:** Monitor closely during monsoon (Nov-Mar)
- **Northern cities:** Watch for regional flooding events

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- **Use weather forecasts** (3-5 days ahead) to predict impact
- **Historical correlation:** Completion rate <90% = rain event
- **Pre-position resources** based on weather forecasts

### 4. Post-Event Analysis
- **Map each disruption day** to actual rain/flood events
- **Identify patterns:** Which cities most vulnerable to which weather types
- **Refine thresholds:** Better predict impact based on rainfall intensity
