## Note on MGS

**MGS** (Merchant Growth Specialist) does not appear as a specific AM name in the data. There are:
- **60,861 merchants** with no AM assigned
- **2,402 merchants** assigned to other AMs

If "MGS" refers to merchants without AM assignment, they would represent a significant portion of Penang merchants but would need separate analysis to determine their impact.
