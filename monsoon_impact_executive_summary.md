## Strategic Implications

### 1. Weather Impact is Significant but Recoverable
- Temporary disruption (1 week) followed by strong recovery
- **Action:** Focus on minimizing disruption duration, not preventing it

### 2. Northern/East Coast Cities are Most Vulnerable
- **Top 3 cities (Penang + Alor Setar + Ipoh) = 72% of total loss** (MYR 4.15M of MYR 5.77M)
- **All northern/east coast cities = 85% of total loss**
- **Alor Setar shows worst single-day impact:** 80.4% completion rate (Oct 3)
- **Action:** Targeted interventions for high-risk cities (Penang, Alor Setar, Ipoh, Kuching, Kota Bharu, Sungai Petani)

### 3. Completion Rate is Best Early Indicator
- Drops to 84-87% = severe disruption
- **Action:** Real-time monitoring with <90% threshold triggers response

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Set up weather monitoring dashboard
2. Develop Week 2 post-mortem with ops team
3. Create driver/merchant communication protocol

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
