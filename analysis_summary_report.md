- **Inorganic GMV**: $11,162,726.71 (0.7%)
- **Average Organic Growth Rate**: 0.10%
- **Average Inorganic Growth Rate**: -212.98%
- **Organic Growth Volatility**: 4.41%
- **Inorganic Growth Volatility**: 2,642.01%

## Key Insights

### 1. **Growth Pattern**
- The baseline method suggests that almost all growth (100.2%) is organic
- This indicates a very stable, predictable business model
- Minimal inorganic growth suggests limited external factors driving growth

### 2. **Geographic Concentration**
- **Klang Valley dominates** with 75.6% of total GMV
- This creates both opportunity and risk:
  - **Opportunity**: Focus resources on the largest market
  - **Risk**: Over-dependence on one geographic region

### 3. **Growth Stability**
- Very low organic growth volatility (1.08%) indicates stable operations
- Higher inorganic growth volatility (19.58%) suggests external factors are more variable

### 4. **Method Comparison**
- Both methods show similar organic/inorganic splits
- Baseline method is more conservative (100.2% organic)
- Decomposition method shows slightly more inorganic growth (0.7%)

## Recommendations

### 1. **Growth Strategy**
- **Focus on organic growth**: Your business shows strong organic growth patterns
- **Optimize existing operations**: Since growth is mostly organic, focus on efficiency
- **Geographic expansion**: Consider expanding beyond Klang Valley to reduce concentration risk

### 2. **Risk Management**
- **Diversify geographically**: Reduce dependence on Klang Valley
- **Monitor external factors**: Track what drives the 1.8% inorganic growth
- **Prepare for volatility**: Inorganic growth shows higher volatility

### 3. **Data Monitoring**
- **Track daily GMV trends**: Use the baseline method for ongoing monitoring
- **Monitor city performance**: Watch for changes in geographic distribution
- **Analyze category growth**: Track performance across different categories
