# MGS Individual Impact Analysis - Setup Required

## Current Status

I have the MGS distribution from your list:
- **Teoh Jun Ling**: 179 merchants
- **Lee Sook Chin**: 134 merchants
- **Low Jia Ying**: 100 merchants
- **Hon Yi Ni**: 81 merchants
- **Total**: 494 merchants

## What's Needed

To provide individual MGS impact analysis (similar to AM analysis), I need:

1. **Merchant IDs** for each MGS assignment
   - The list you provided shows MGS names but not merchant IDs
   - Need to match merchant IDs from Main Tracker V2 with MGS assignments

2. **Data Source Options**:
   - Option A: Read Main Tracker V2 Google Sheet to get merchant IDs + MGS assignments
   - Option B: You provide merchant IDs for each MGS
   - Option C: Use existing segmentation mapping (limited - only has a few merchants)

## Next Steps

1. **Read Main Tracker V2 Sheet**: I can create a script to read the sheet and extract merchant IDs with their MGS assignments
2. **Generate Queries**: Once I have merchant IDs, I'll generate queries for each MGS
3. **Execute & Analyze**: Run queries to get individual impact metrics for each MGS

## Impact Metrics to Calculate (Same as AM Analysis)

For each MGS, I'll calculate:
- Total GMV (6 months)
- % of Penang GMV
- Unique merchants
- Total orders
- Unique eaters
- Average GMV per merchant
- Average GMV per order
- Average GMV per eater
- Growth rate (first 3m vs last 3m)
- Monthly trends

## Would you like me to:

1. **Read the Main Tracker V2 sheet** to get merchant IDs? (Requires Google Sheets API access)
2. **Or provide the merchant IDs** in a different format?

Let me know and I'll proceed with the analysis!
